## Hey ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m a software engineer who vibes with building dope stuff â€” web, mobile, desktop apps, all of it. Iâ€™m all about clean code, smooth UX, and features that actually slap.

Right now, Iâ€™m crafting cool things @ KYRO SAAS and living that open source life ðŸ’»âœ¨

Specially obsessed with: Mapbox for maps that wow, Algolia for blazing-fast search, Next.js + MUI for sleek UIs, and TypeScript to keep my code crisp. I also run tests with Jest & Playwright so nothing breaks on my watch ðŸš€
